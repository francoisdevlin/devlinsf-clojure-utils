This is a proposed change for str-utils.  There are a few key changes, which can be summarized as follows.

* The re-* methods can now take a list of regexes, and each is applied recursively.
* Several utility methods have been added to simply common string manipulations.
* str-take & str-drop methods have been created, which simplify substring operations and splitting once on a regex.
* re-split is written in terms of re-partition.  The result is re-split is now lazy.

=== Installation ===
